Abstract 
The generalized pinball loss function was introduced to improve the noise sensitiv- ity and random instability of the original 
support vector machine (SVM). However, because the generalized pinball loss function is not smooth, SVM that uses it (GP- loss-SVM) 
is non-differentiable. From this issue, it makes the several practical algo- rithms that cannot be used to find the solution. As a result, 
GP-loss-SVM performs less effectively in practice. In order to solve this problem and improve GP-loss-SVM, in this paper, we construct 
a new smooth approximation function of the generalized pinball loss function into the SVM. As a result, a smooth SVM with the generalized pinball 
loss function is obtained. Furthermore, we use an effective method, quasi- Newtonâ€“Armijo, to solve our model. Moreover, we prove that 
our new loss function can estimate the generalized pinball loss function. Finally, we conduct a thorough experimental investigation employing a variety 
of machine learning benchmark datasets. The experiment results on binary datasets show that the proposed method outperforms the original 
SVM method by up to 1.59% for linear kernel and 1.45% for nonlinear kernel; the experiment results on multi-class datasets show that the proposed method 
outperforms the baseline model by up to 1.43% for linear kernels. We also evaluate the statistical significance of the performance values attained for 
the various models using the Friedman test. The results demonstrate that the average rank of the proposed method is better compared to baseline models.
